# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
# another five tests evaluate to False.



food = 'pizza'

# True tests
print("Is food == 'pizza'? I predict True.")
print(food == 'pizza')  # True


# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
# variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
# • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
# a message that the player just earned 5 points.
# • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
# fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

# alien_color is green, so the condition will pass
alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")

# alien_color is red, so the condition will not pass
alien_color = 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points!")  # This line won't run



# 5-4. Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and
# write an if-else chain.
# • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned
# 5 points for shooting the alien.
# • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned
# 10 points.
# • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that
# runs the else block.


alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points for shooting the alien!")
else:
    print("You just earned 10 points.")


# 5-5. Alien Colors #3: Turn your if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elif-
# else chain.
# • If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
# • If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
# • If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
# • Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed
# for the appropriate color alien.


alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("You just earned 5 points.")
elif alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("You just earned 10 points.")
else:
    print("You just earned 15 points.")



# 5-6. Stages of Life: Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s
# stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
# • If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is
# a baby.
# • If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that
# the person is a toddler.
# • If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that
# the person is a kid.
# • If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that
# the person is a teenager.
# • If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that
# the person is an adult.
# • If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an
# elder.


age = 30 

if age < 2:
    print("The person is a baby.")
elif age >= 2 and age < 4:
    print("The person is a toddler.")
elif age >= 4 and age < 13:
    print("The person is a kid.")
elif age >= 13 and age < 20:
    print("The person is a teenager.")
elif age >= 20 and age < 65:
    print("The person is an adult.")
else:
    print("The person is an elder.")



# 5-7. Favorite Fruit: Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
# independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
# • Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
# is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement,
# such as You really like bananas!


# List of favorite fruits
favorite_fruits = ['mango', 'banana', 'apple']

# Check for specific fruits
if 'banana' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like bananas!")

if 'mango' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like mangoes!")

if 'orange' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like oranges!")



# 5-8. Hello Admin: Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name
# 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user
# after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to
# each user:
# • If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin,
# would you like to see a status report?
# • Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Jaden, thank you for
# logging in again.


usernames = ['admin', 'sara', 'mike', 'olivia']

for user in usernames:
    if user == 'admin':
        print("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?")
    else:
        print(f"Hello {user.title()}, thank you for logging in again.")




# 5-9. No Users: Add an if test to hello_admin.py to make sure the list of users is
# not empty.
# • If the list is empty, print the message We need to find some users!
# • Remove all of the usernames from your list, and make sure the correct
# message is printed.

usernames = ['admin', 'jaden', 'sara', 'mike', 'olivia']

if usernames:
    for user in usernames:
        if user == 'admin':
            print("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?")
        else:
            print(f"Hello {user.title()}, thank you for logging in again.")
else:
    print("We need to find some users!")





# 5-11. Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers indicate their position in a list, such
# as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, except 1, 2, and 3.
# • Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list.
# • Loop through the list.
# • Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal end-
# ing for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th
# 7th 8th 9th", and each result should be on a separate line.


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

for number in numbers:
    if number == 1:
        print(f"{number}st")
    elif number == 2:
        print(f"{number}nd")
    elif number == 3:
        print(f"{number}rd")
    else:
        print(f"{number}th")
